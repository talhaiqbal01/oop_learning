# Object

In OOP, `Objects` are things created from classes that have data (attributes) and actions (methods).

# Code Explanation

Here, we created a `Person` class with attributes like `name` (a `String`) and `age` (an `int`). It also includes methods. To use this class, we create an instance of `Person` class in the `main` class. This instance is called an `Object`.

``` java
Person person = new Person("Alice", 25);
```
