# Attributes

In OOP, `Attributes` store data for an object and are defined in the class.

# Code Explanation

Here, we defined a `Person` class with attributes like `name` (a `String`) and `age` (an `int`). We can store data of certain types inside these variables.

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
}
```
